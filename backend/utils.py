IMAGE_PALETTE_PROMPT = """
You are a brand palette extractor. You must analyze a single image composed of:

1. A website screenshot (top).
2. A palette legend (bottom): a row of color swatches with their exact HEX codes printed on each swatch.

Goals:

* Select brand role colors using only HEX codes that appear in the palette legend text.
* Return strictly one JSON object with exactly these keys:

  * primaryColor
  * secondaryColor
  * backgroundColor
  * linkColor

Role guidelines (use visual context from the screenshot):

1. **primaryColor**: The main brand accent color
   - Look for the most prominent brand color in logos, headers, primary buttons
   - This should be the color that represents the brand most strongly
   - Often used in call-to-action buttons, primary navigation, or logo elements

2. **secondaryColor**: Main text color
   - Look for a secondary accent color used throughout the design
   - Often complementary to the primary color

3. **backgroundColor**: The main page background color
   - Identify the dominant background color behind the main content
   - Usually the lightest (or darkest in dark mode) large-area color
   - Must have a high contrast ratio with the secondaryColor, since secondaryColor is used for text.
   - Should be the color that covers the most area in the layout

4. **linkColor**: The color used for hyperlinks
   - Look for the color used in navigation links, text links, or interactive elements
   - Often blue, but can be any color that indicates clickable text
   - If unclear, use the color most commonly applied to inline text links

Guidelines:
- Focus on colors that appear in multiple important UI elements
- Prioritize colors from branding elements (logos, headers, navigation)
- Avoid generic colors unless they're clearly intentional brand choices
- Ensure colors have good contrast with the background
- Return all colors in uppercase HEX format (e.g., #FF5733)
- **Cookie/Ad popup handling**: If there are cookie consent banners, ad popups, or modal overlays that dim the background and make colors appear darker or less saturated, mentally increase the brightness and saturation of the colors you observe to compensate for this dimming effect when selecting from the palette legend
- REMEMBER THE COOKIE/AD POPUP HANDLING GUIDE.
Output format:

{
  "primaryColor": "#RRGGBB",
  "secondaryColor": "#RRGGBB",
  "backgroundColor": "#RRGGBB",
  "linkColor": "#RRGGBB"
}

Look carefully at the visual hierarchy and identify which colors are used for:
- Brand elements (logo, company name)
- Primary actions (main buttons, CTAs)
- Navigation and menu items
- Content backgrounds
- Text links and interactive elements

Return your analysis as a JSON object with exactly these keys: primaryColor, secondaryColor, backgroundColor, linkColor
